# PLAID - The GridPane Stack

This stack/install of LOMP7+ (Linux, OpenResty, MariaDB 10.3 and PHP7.1+) is for use with GridPane provisioned servers. You can certainly use it on your own, outside of the GridPane SaaS service without support or updates. 

YMMV, Use at your own risk, all that jazz...
